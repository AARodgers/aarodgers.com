        <p class="mb-3">
          I'm Amanda Rodgers, an advocate and software developer in the Boulder, Colorado area. I am passionate about
          the intersection of healthcare, finance, education, and technology because I believe they can help us build a
          healthier, safer, and more equitable world for everyone.
        </p>

          My most recent experience was as an Integrations Engineer at BillGO,
          a fintech that does
          billpay software. I used C# to fix and build users' eBill integrations on their Prism app which allows them to
          put all of their bills in one
          place. One of my personal achievements there was creating new documentation and dashboards using Grafana/Kusto
          to organize files and procedures to increase efficiency and eliminate redunancy resulting in saving many
          engineering hours.

          On the side, I work on my non-profit <a href="https://womensdirectory.org/" target="_blank">Women's
            Directory</a>, a free online resource that helps women in the Denver area find critical resources in times
          of need.
          My goal for Womenâ€™s Directory is to give women hope by getting them the help they need and deserve for
          themselves and their
          families. It is a Ruby on Rails app and is open-source so that we can collaborate with contributors
          on new features, improvements, and bug fixes. You can find the repo here: <a
            href="github.com/Womens-Directory/womens-directory" target="_blank">Women's Directory</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          I am open to work opportunities in software engineering that are in the Boulder area or fully remote.

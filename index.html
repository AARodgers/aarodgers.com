          I'm Amanda Rodgers, an advocate and software developer in the Boulder, Colorado area. I am passionate about
          the intersection of healthcare, education, and technology because I believe they can help us build a
          healthier, safer, and more equitable world for everyone.

          My current focus is on building <a href="https://womensdirectory.org/" target="_blank">Women's Directory</a>,
          a free online resource that helps women in the Denver area find the help that they need. I started this
          initiative after working 15 years in healthcare and education. Through my daily experiences in public health
          clinics and classrooms, I saw how much we need to do to repair the trauma and help women secure basic human
          rights. My goal for Womenâ€™s Directory is to give women hope by getting them the help they need and deserve for
          themselves and their families.
        </p>

          I am currently open for work opportunities in software engineering.

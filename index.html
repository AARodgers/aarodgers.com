        <p class="mb-3">
          I'm Amanda Rodgers, an advocate, software engineer and data analyst in the Boulder and Denver, Colorado area.
          I am passionate about
          the intersection of healthcare, finance, education, and technology because I believe they can help us build a
          healthier, safer, and more equitable world for everyone.
        </p>

          I am currently working towards a data engineering certificate and my last job was as an Analytics Consultant
          helping the IRS find tax fraud using
          entity resolution software and predictive models. Before that, I worked as an Integrations Engineer at BillGO,
          a fintech that does billpay software. I used C# and browser data to fix file integrations to an eBill app that
          helps users manage their bills. My passion for technology and how it can impact human lives led me to create
          <a href="https://womensdirectory.org/" target="_blank">Women's Directory</a>, a free online website that
          helps women in the Denver area find critical resources in times of need. It is a collective effort and a Ruby
          on Rails app. It is
          open-source on GitHub for collaboration. See below for other projects I have worked on.

          I organized and plotted my monthly expenses using R language, R Studio and Tidyverse packages.

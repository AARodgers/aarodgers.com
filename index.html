        <p class="mb-3">
          I'm Amanda Rodgers, an advocate, software developer and data analyst in the Boulder and Denver, Colorado area. I am passionate about
          the intersection of healthcare, finance, education, and technology because I believe they can help us build a
          healthier, safer, and more equitable world for everyone.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          I am currently finishing up a data analytics bootcamp where I am building projects using R Studio and Python.
          My most recent experience was as an Integrations Engineer at BillGO, a fintech that does
          billpay software. I used C# to fix and build users' eBill integrations on their Prism app which allows them to
          put all of their bills in one place. One of my personal achievements there was creating new documentation
          and dashboards using Grafana and Kusto Query Language to organize code libraries and procedures. These dashboards
          increased the engineers' efficiency and eliminated redunancy saving many engineering hours.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          My passion for technology and how it can impact human's lives led me to create
          <a href="https://womensdirectory.org/" target="_blank">Women's Directory</a>, a free online website that
          helps women in the Denver area find critical resources in times of need. It is a Ruby on Rails app and is
          open-source on GitHub for collaboration.
        </p>
